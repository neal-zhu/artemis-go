# Artemis-Go

Artemis-Go is a Go-based fork of the Artemis project, focusing on Ethereum block header monitoring and processing. This fork was developed with the assistance of an AI programming cursor.

## About

This project is forked from [Artemis](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/artemis), reimplementing its core functionality in Go.

## Features

- Real-time Ethereum block header collection
- Customizable strategies for data processing
- Flexible execution engine
- Graceful shutdown handling

## Architecture

Artemis-Go is built on a modular architecture consisting of three main components:

### Collectors

Collectors are responsible for gathering data from external sources. They can be customized to fetch various types of data from different sources.

### Strategies

Strategies process the data collected by collectors and determine what actions should be taken. They can be implemented to handle different types of data and make decisions based on custom logic.

### Executors

Executors carry out the actions determined by strategies. They can be designed to perform a wide range of operations based on the processed data.

This architecture allows for easy extension and customization of the system. New collectors can be added to gather different types of data, new strategies can be implemented to process data in various ways, and new executors can be created to perform different actions based on the processed data.

## Usage

To run the example:

```bash
go run examples/print_header/main.go -eth-url <eth_url>
```

Replace `<eth_url>` with the URL of your Ethereum node.
